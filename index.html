<p>Hello, and welcome to my podcast! My name is Elise Brooklynn, and this microblog was inspired by a quote of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_of_Lisieux">St. Thérèse of Lisieux</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The only way I can prove my love is by scattering flowers and these flowers are every little sacrifice, every glance and word, and the doing of the least actions for love.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through the <a href="https://scatteringflowers.com/categories/daily-readings/">daily bible readings of the Mass</a>, I hope to scatter flowers every day as a little sacrifice of love.</p>
